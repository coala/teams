Responsibilities of coala’s GSoC Participants
=============================================

This Document hold the responsibilities we expect coala’s GSoC participants to
fulfil.

The coala's GSoC participants and mentors are also required to follow our 
coala community's [Code of Conduct](https://coala.io/coc).


Students
--------

### During Application Phase:

- Complete the coala newcomer guide.
- Decide on one, max. two projects to apply for.
- Get in touch with the mentors for those projects.
- Start to work on issue from the area of the projects.
- Start to write the proposals drafts as early as possible to receive feedback.
- Merge all pending PRs that are not related to the project.

### After being accepted:

#### Bonding Phase

- Get in touch with your mentor.
- Write a project description on http://projects.coala.io/
- Finish any incomplete pre-requisites.
- The first two weeks of the bonding period are strictly for scheduling time.
  This means that besides setting up the schedule, students should only work
  on things like cEPs.
  Writing code during this time instead without agreement of the mentor can be
  a reason to fail a student.
- The second half of the bonding period should focus on finishing schedules and
  cEPs. Writing small prototypes can be ok to help with scheduling but real coding
  must wait until after the initial scheduling is complete and accepted by the
  mentor.
- Create milestones for your project:
    - Request `master` access to the project within https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/
    - Create milestones with the following names:
    - BONDING_[project name]
    - PHASE_1_[project name]
    - PHASE_2_[project name]
    - PHASE_3_[project name]
- Then you can create issues for your phases. Your schedule has to be approved
  by your mentor by the end of the bonding phase.
- Add the milestones to your project in the
  [projects list](https://github.com/coala/projects/blob/master/_projects/).
- Create issues with the tasks you have scheduled so far and add them to the
  milestones.
- Participate in community bonding events.
- Get a better understanding for the project, the problems lying ahead and
  improve the schedule.
- Help with code reviews.
- Start writing a weekly blog. Get your feed into the coala blog.
- Hold some kind of 1 on 1 session with your mentor once a week, updating them
  about your progress, problems and achievements.
- Get comfortable with the community and work at coala.
- Apply for a passport and visa if you want to meet coala at a conference and
  need it.
- Talk to your mentor if any problems arise.
- Talk to an org admin if any problems with your mentor arise asap.


#### Coding Phase

- Follow your schedule.
  Communicate any problems with your mentor asap.
  If you fail to do this, we'll have to fail you.
- Update milestones and issues as you go along.
- Keep writing your blog every week.
- Hold some kind of 1 on 1 session with your mentor once a week, updating them
  about your progress, problems and achievements.
- Update the schedule during those meetings, together with your mentor.
- Review PRs, prioritizing those from your project's area.
- Talk to your mentor if any problems arise.

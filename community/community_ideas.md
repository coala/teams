__Maximilian Scholz (Leader):__

"Hi, I'm Max and sometimes called the Secretary of Offtopic (mainly by myself).
I joined coala in early 2015 but real contributions started 2016. I mainly
work on coala by giving input on design questions helping with administrative
tasks. My biggest impact on coala so far probably was the community work during
the second GSoC coala participated in and my conference visits. From that time
the title Secretary of Offtopic stems."

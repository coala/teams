This template is for team leader/member applications. Remove this paragraph. Set `<Team Name> Member Application: <Your Full Name>` (use `Leader` instead of member obviously if you want to apply for leadership) as issue title. If your proposal isn't ready yet, prefix the issue title with `WIP:`.

As a team leader you're expected to make a rather verbose application compared to members.

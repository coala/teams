__[Udayan Tandon](https://github.com/udayan12167) (Leader):__

"I'm Udayan Tandon. I have been a part of coala since early 2015. I have seen
coala evolve from its very primitive stages to the behemoth it is now. Mostly
being involved in these evolutions. I'm also fresh out of university where my
main research area was Program Analysis and my work won the best thesis award
as well. I have also designed the new core of coala which is under
implementation right now. Hence due to my heavy involvement in a field
relevant to coala I'm mostly updated on potential research and development
oppurtunities. I also have experience in doing challenging and new projects
which would help with the guidance of the research team. I'll always be
present to guide research project as I have an idea about the commitment and
work required to drive them to completion."

Udayan is responsible for:

- Managing and Organizing the team's activities.
- Providing help with Research projects.
- Identifying new Research opportunities.

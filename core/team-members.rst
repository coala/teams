`Adhityaa Chandrasekar <https://github.com/adtac>`_ (Glorious Leader)

Hi, I'm Adhityaa. I did a GSoC under coala once and I've been here ever
since. I'm quite familiar with coala's core library (well, duh, I'm the
leader). I also wrote most of `coala-quickstart` (a tool that is better than
another tool called `cib`). Also, Arsenal is the greatest club in the world.

`Lasse Schuirmann <https://github.com/sils>`_

I'm sils. I created coala. Thrice. I'll be pushing some initiatives to radically
improve coala! This will mainly include cEP-0005 and metrics for coala.

Hi, I'm Rohan. I'm a 21 year old engineer in the making. I love my macbook,
it loves me back most of the time. Other things that interest me includes
mainstream anime (bleach, fma:b, stuff like that.) and reading mostly
non-fiction books. I look forward to doing the biddings of the glorious
leader (do we really have to call you that?)
